form for professional claims or a CMS-1450 claim form for institutional claims (or successor
forms), or the electronic equivalent in the manner and to the location described in the Provider

benefit verification and claims processing, Provider will use such electronic interface systems.
Provider must use HIPAA compliant billing codes when billing or submitting encounter
data. This applies to both electronic and paper claims. When billing codes are updated, Provider

its discretion, may amend the Agreement as it deems necessary to clarify

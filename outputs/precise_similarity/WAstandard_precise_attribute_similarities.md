Provider agrees to accept as payment in full, in all circumstances, the applicable Rate
whether such payment is in the form of a Cost Share, a payment by Plan, or a payment by another
source, such as through coordination of benefits or subrogation. Provider shall bill, collect, and
accept compensation for Cost Shares. Provider agrees to make reasonable efforts to verify Cost
Shares prior to billing for such Cost Shares. In no event shall Plan be obligated to pay Provider or
any person acting on behalf of Provider for services that are not Covered Services, or any amounts
in excess of the Rate less Cost Shares or payment by another source, as set forth above.
Consistent with the foregoing, Provider agrees to accept the Rate as payment in full if the

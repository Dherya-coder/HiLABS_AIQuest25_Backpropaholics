Hold Harmless. In addition to the hold harmless provision in the Agreement, Provider agrees that in no event,
including but not limited to non-payment by Plan, insolvency of Plan or breach of the Agreement, shall Provider
bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration or reimbursement from, or have any
recourse against a MA Member or persons other than Plan acting on their behalf for MA Covered Services
provided pursuant to this Attachment. This section does not prohibit the collection of supplemental charges
or Cost Shares on Plan's behalf made in accordance with the terms of the MA Member's Health Benefit Plan
or amounts due for services that have been correctly identified in advance as a non-MA Covered Service,
subject to medical coverage criteria, with appropriate disclosure to the MA Member of their financial obligation.
This advance notice must be provided in accordance with the CMS regulations for Medicare Advantage
organizations. CMS regulations require that a coverage determination be made with a standard denial notice
(Notice of Denial of Medical Coverage (or Payment)/CMS-10003) for a non-Covered Service when such
Health Service is typically not covered, but could be covered under specific conditions. If prior to rendering
the non-Covered Service, Provider obtains, or instructs the MA Member to obtain, a coverage determination
of a non-Covered Service(s), the MA Member can be held financially responsible for non-Covered Services.

Provider agrees to accept as payment in full, in all circumstances, the applicable Rate
whether such payment is in the form of a Cost Share, a payment by Plan, or a payment by another
source, such as through coordination of benefits or subrogation. Provider shall bill, collect, and
accept compensation for Cost Shares. Provider agrees to make reasonable efforts to verify Cost
Shares prior to billing for such Cost Shares. In no event shall Plan be obligated to pay Provider or
any person acting on behalf of Provider for services that are not Covered Services, or any amounts
in excess of the Rate less Cost Shares or payment by another source, as set forth above.
Consistent with the foregoing, Provider agrees to accept the Rate as payment in full if the
Member has not yet satisfied his/her deductible.

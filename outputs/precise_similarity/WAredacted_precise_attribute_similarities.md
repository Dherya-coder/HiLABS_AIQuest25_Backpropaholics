Notwithstanding any other provision in\nthis Agreement applicable to non-Covered Services, Provider is not prohibited from the\ncollection of amounts due for Medicare services that have been correctly identified in advance as\na non-Covered Service, subject to medical coverage criteria, with appropriate disclosure to the\nCovered Person of his/her financial obligation. This advance notice must be provided in\naccordance with the CMS regulations for Medicare Advantage organizations. CMS regulations\nrequire that a coverage determination be made with a standard denial notice (Notice of Denial of\nMedical Coverage (or Payment)/CMS-10003) for a non-Covered Service or item when such\nservice or item is typically not covered, but could be covered under specific conditions. If prior\nto rendering the service or item, Provider obtains, or instructs the Covered Person to obtain, a\ncoverage determination of a non-Covered Service or item, the Covered Person can be held\nfinancially responsible for such non-Covered Services or items. However, if a service or item is\nnever covered by such as a statutory exclusion, and the Covered Person's\nEvidence of Coverage (EOC) clearly specifies that the service or item is never covered, Provider\ndoes not have to seek a coverage determination from in order to hold the\nCovered Person responsible for the full cost of the service or item.

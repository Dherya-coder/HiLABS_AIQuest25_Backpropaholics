shall Provider bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration or reimbursement from,
or have any recourse against a MA Member or persons other than acting on their behalf for MA

supplemental charges or Cost Shares on behalf made in accordance with the terms of the MA
Member's Health Benefit Plan or amounts due for services that have been correctly identified in advance as
a non-MA Covered Service, subject to medical coverage criteria, with appropriate disclosure to the MA
Member of their financial obligation. This advance notice must be provided in accordance with the CMS

non-Covered Service when such Health Service is typically not covered, but could be covered under specific
conditions. If prior to rendering the non-Covered Service, Provider obtains, or instructs the MA Member to
obtain, a coverage determination of a non-Covered Service(s), the MA Member can be held financially

## 7.2
Arbitration. Any dispute within the scope of subsection 7.1.1 that remains unresolved at the conclusion of the

hereafter represent, each agree to and do hereby waive any right to join or consolidate claims in

dispute and that such dispute shall be decided instead in a court of competent jurisdiction.

of the mediator, fee of the independent arbitrator) will be shared equally between the parties. Each party
shall be responsible for the payment of its own specific fees and costs (e.g. the party's own attorney's fees,
the fees of the party selected arbitrator, etc.) and any costs associated with conducting the non-binding
mediation or arbitration that the party chooses to incur (e.g. expert witness fees, depositions, etc.).

aaa Payment Reform Initiatives for the purposes of furthering quality improvement and reporting processes in
accordance with requirements. Episodes and quality measures defined > will be provided
within the rovider Episode-Based Retrospective Payment Appendix resholds Attachment.
— Shall provide quarterly performance reports to Provider and Quarterbacks and shall reconcile episode
performance annually.

aligning reimbursement with health care ually shall implement this Program as described in this
Episode-Based Retrospective Payment Appendix (this “Appendix’), in accordance with requirements.
Provider acknowledges the a oe is implementing an Episode of Care payment system for
compensation of Providers deemed to have the greatest accountability for quality and cost of care for a patient.
Providers deemed to have the greatest accountability for the quality and cost of care for a patient are “Principal
Accountable Providers" or "PAPs" or “Quarterbacks”.
Provider agrees that a Quarterback, as identified >y i or each episode of care and as defined herein, is
required by he a Program to participate and cooperate with ae purposes of furthering quality
improvement and reporting processes as developed for this program and described a Episodes and
quality measures defined by | are identified in the attached J Thresholds Atiachment, which is
incorporated herein.
ma shall provide quarterly performance reports to the Quarterback and shall reconcile episode performance
annually.
Additional episodes will be identified and added as determined by Jy EES will work with I to

Section | - Definitions
Acceptable Cost Threshold: The dollar amount, as determined by NN to which the Quarterbacks’ risk
adjusted average episode cost (calculated in Section II below) for a Program Episode will be compared. The
Acce} le Cost Threshold is used to determine the dollar amount of the Shared Risk Payment from the Quarterback
to and can be found on each interim and final Performance Report provided to the Quarterback. For the
Acceptable Cost Threshold, the threshold represents the maximum cost in that category. Providers with a cost equal
to or less than the threshold meet the threshold requirement. See thresholds attachment.
Commendable Cost Threshold: The dollar amount, as determined to which the Quarterback's risk
adjusted average episode cost for a Program Episode will be compared. If the Quarterback meets all of the quality
indicators linked to gain sharing, the commendable cost threshold is then used to the determine dollar amount of a
shared savings payment ton ae to the Quarterback, subject to the Gain Share Limit. The dollar amount of
the commendable cost threshold can be found on each interim and final Performance Report provided to the
Quarterback. For the Commendable Cost Threshold, the threshold represents the maximum cost in that category.
Providers with a cost equal to or less than the threshold meet the threshold requirement. See thresholds attachment.
Cost Zones: Based on the prior quarter average episode costs, as calculated in Section II below, Quarterback Zone,
or Commendable Cost Zone.

specialized health care event, net of episodes excluded for clinical or operational considerations.
Episode Measurement Period ("EMP"): The measurement period for the Quality Certification Component of the
program defined as including all episodes ending the 12-month period that begins on the effective date of this
Appendix. Subsequently measurement periods will begin as defined by
Episode Provider Stop-loss: A methodology that will be incorporated into the Total Episode Cost calculation that is
designed to limit significant provider risk under the episode of care model. The Episode Provider Stop-loss is not
intended to be a regulated stop loss or reinsurance product, but rather is a calculation integrated within the Risk
Sharing component of the Program intended to provide protection from the impact of excessive Quarterback
penalties.
Gain Share Limit: Calculated, as defined > as the average of the non-adjusted cost for the five lowest
costs for a valid Episode of Care that will be use culate any shared savings payment to the Quarterback, if all
of the eligibility criteria are met.
Gain Sharing: If a Quarterback achieves a risk-adjusted average per-episode cost below the commendable
threshold while meeting quality standards, then the Quarterback is eligible for Gain Sharing. Gain Sharing is savings
below the commendable threshold with respect to the Gain Share Limit.
Member: A Member is a Medicaid enrollee assigned —_— by the state Medicaid program. A Member is
subject to retroactive disenroliment by the state, in which case such individual will not be considered a Member for
any period as of the effective date of such disenrollment.

an interim or final basis, the Quarterback's performance results and the other information described in this Appendix.
Principal Accountable Provider ("PAP" or “Quarterback"): The Provider deemed to have the greatest
accountability for the quality and cost of care for a patient. Quarterbacks are designated for each episode based on
the degree of influence they have over clinical decisions and the care delivered.
Quality Certification Component: The program component that measures the quality performance of the
Quarterback. The quarterly quality certification is a prerequisite for becoming and remaining eligible for Gain Sharing.
The quality certification designation will apply to those Quarterbacks that have a score meeting or exceeding
= defined threshold levels for Quality Indicators Linked to Gain Sharing.
Quality Indicators Linked To Gain Sharing: The set of indicators that will be used for determination of quality
certification of each episode. These quality indicators will be based on clinically appropriate and evidence-based
practice. Applicable quality indicator definitions and measurement specifications will be published with each episode.
The thresholds for Quality Indicators Linked to Gain Sharing, represent the minimum score required to meet the
metric. Quality results equal to or higher than the threshold are considered to have met the requirements for the
measure. See thresholds attachment.
Quality Indicators Not Linked To Gain Sharing: The additional set of indicators that will be provided to each
Quarterback of each episode for the purpose of quality improvement. These quality indicators will be based on
clinically appropriate and evidence-based practice. Applicable quality indicator definitions and measurement
specifications will be published with each episode. The thresholds for Quality Indicators Not Linked to Gain Sharing,
represent the minimum score required to meet the metric. Quality results equal to or higher than the threshold are
considered to have met the requirements for the measure.

The Quarterback's performance will be measured for each episode in reports. Average episode cost (risk
adjusted) will be compared with pre-determined thresholds. Based on performance, Fi” will then reconcile
total payment with each Quarterback. This performance summary will provide a detailed picture of the quality
indicators of a Quarterback that go into the Quarterback’s quality outcomes and how the Quarterback is performing
relative to other Quarterbacks in this episode.
Cost ranges for commendable, acceptable and unacceptable costs will also be included in the report. If the
Quarterback's costs are considered unacceptable, the Quarterback will be subject to risk sharing. If the Quarterback’s
costs are in the acceptable range, there will be neither gain nor risk sharing. If the Quarterback's costs are within the
commendable range, the Quarterback will be eligible for gain sharing as long as the Quarterback met required quality
metrics.
# Section V - Eligibility - Quality Certification

A. Those services that are recommended by a physician or other licensed healthcare provider practicing within
the scope of the physician's license who is treating the Medicaid Member. A Medically Necessary Medicaid
Covered Service must satisfy each of the following criteria:
@ It must be required in order to diagnose or treat a Medicaid Member's medical condition. The
convenience of a Medicaid Member, a Medicaid Member's family, or a provider shall not be a factor
or justification in determining that a medical item or service is Medically Necessary;
(ii) It must be safe and effective. To qualify as safe and effective, the type and level of medical item or
service must be consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of the particular medical
condition, and the reasonably anticipated medical benefits of the item or service must outweigh the
reasonably anticipated medical risks based on the Medicaid Member's condition and scientifically
supported evidence;
(iii) It must be the least costly alternative course of diagnosis or treatment that is adequate for the
medical condition of the Medicaid Member. When applied to medical items or services delivered in
an inpatient setting, it further means that the medical item or service cannot be safely provided for
the same or lesser cost to the person in an outpatient setting. Where there are less costly
alternative courses of diagnosis or treatment, including less costly alternative settings that are
adequate for the medical condition of the Medicaid Member, more costly alternative courses of
diagnosis or treatment are not Medically Necessary. An alternative course of diagnosis or treatment
may include observation, lifestyle or behavioral changes or, where appropriate, no treatment at all;
and
(iv) It must not be experimental or investigational. A medical item or service is experimental or
investigational if there is inadequate empirically-based objective clinical scientific evidence of its
safety and effectiveness for the particular use in question. This standard is not satisfied by a
provider's subjective clinical judgment on the safety and effectiveness of a medical item or service
or by a reasonable medical or clinical hypothesis based on an extrapolation from use in another
setting or from use in diagnosing or treating another condition such as:
(a) Use of a drug or biological product that has not been approved under a new drug
application for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
is deemed experimental; or
(b) Use of a drug or biological product that has been approved for marketing by the FDA
but is proposed to be used for other than the FDA-approved purpose. It will not be
deemed Medically Necessary unless the use can be shown to be widespread, to be
generally accepted by the professional medical community as an effective and proven
treatment in the setting and for the condition for which it is used, and to satisfy the
requirements of subdivisions (A)(i) — (A)(iii).
B. Itis the responsibility of the Medicaid Program ultimately to determine what medical items and services are
Medically Necessary for the Medicaid Program. The fact that a provider has prescribed, recommended or
approved a medical item or service does not, in itself, make such item or service Medically Necessary.
Medical Necessity and Medically Necessary as used in the Agreement shall have the meaning contained in
Tenn. Code Ann. 71-5-144, — Rule 1200-13-16, and oer tules, as applicable. In the
